## Running the Web Application

To run the web application, you need to have Streamlit installed. If it's not installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit
pip install joblib
```

Once Streamlit is installed, you can run the web application using the following command:

```bash 
streamlit run WebApp.py
```

After running this command, a new browser window should open displaying the web application.
